leJOS EV3 0.8.0 release
=======================

See the [Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Getting%20started%20with%20leJOS%20EV3/) for how to install leJOS EV3.

The only file you should need is lejosimage.zip.

The sd500.zip file contains a single file sd500.img which can be used to reformat your SD card, if it is not already 
suitably formatted for use with leJOS EV3.
